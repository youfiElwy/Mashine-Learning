# Used Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars by exploring and implementing linear and polynomial regression techniques. The primary goal is to gain a practical understanding of these regression methods and their applications.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about used cars, divided into two CSV files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The attributes include:
- Name
- Manufacturing Year
- Selling Price
- Kilometers Driven
- Fuel Type
- Seller Type
- Transmission
- Owner History

## Linear Regression

### Approaches:
1. **Multi-Feature Equation:** Implement linear regression using the multi-feature equation approach.
2. **Gradient Descent:** Implement linear regression using the gradient descent approach.

### Evaluation:
Both approaches will be evaluated using RMSE, MSE, and MAE metrics to compare their performance.

## Polynomial Regression

Using the same dataset, Polynomial Regression models will be implemented with degrees ranging from 1 to 10. The RMSE values for each degree will be calculated, and a plot will be created to visualize the relationship between the polynomial degree and RMSE.

## Report

A PDF report will be created to document:
- The residual errors and RMSE values for both the Multi-Feature Equation and Gradient Descent approaches in linear regression.
- A performance comparison of the linear regression approaches.
- The residual errors and RMSE values for each polynomial degree.
- The optimal polynomial degree based on the results and analysis.
