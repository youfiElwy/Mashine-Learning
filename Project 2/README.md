# Machine Learning Projects Overview

## Project 1: Used Car Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars by implementing linear and polynomial regression techniques. The dataset includes various attributes of used cars, such as manufacturing year, kilometers driven, and more. The project involves:
- Implementing linear regression using Multi-Feature Equation and Gradient Descent.
- Implementing polynomial regression models with degrees ranging from 1 to 10.
- Evaluating models using RMSE, MSE, and MAE metrics.

## Project 2: Cat and Dog Image Classification Using CLIP Embeddings

This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training) embeddings and the Fisher algorithm. The workflow includes:
- Extracting CLIP embeddings for images in the dataset.
- Implementing the Fisher algorithm for classification.
- Evaluating the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualizing results with a confusion matrix.
- Experimenting with different values of C in the Fisher algorithm.
